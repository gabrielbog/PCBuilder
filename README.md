# PCBuilder

Right now, this application allows you to select from 3 different pre-built PC options.

I used Factory Pattern for the components, Builder Pattern for the PC creation, Singleton Pattern for the menu instance.
I also used models and repositories in order to have the menu list nicely loaded and organized. They also use Singleton pattern during creation.

In the future, it would be nice to implement the Prototype Pattern in order to copy one of the PC configurations and swap parts with any part the user desires.
