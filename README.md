# PCBuilder

Right now, this application allows you to select from 3 different pre-built PC options.

I used Factory Pattern for the components, Builder Pattern for the PC creation, Singleton for the menu instance.
I also used models and repositories in order to have the menu list nicely loaded and organized.
